To set the data, plese follow the data set up instructions in the readme file.

The ctc_torch noteboook is used for the traditional models.
The save_path variable should be changed to one of these values:
'Models/trained_agnostic_model.pth' for normal agnostic
'Models/trained_agnostic_distorted_model.pth' for distorted agnostic
'Models/trained_semantic_model.pth' for normal semantic
'Models/trained_semantic_distorted_model.pth' for distorted semantic
Note that the variables semantic and distorted also need to change their boolean values accordingly
The prepared variable is used to either load a pretrained model and skip training (True) or train model and save it to save_path

The ctc_mtl_torch notebook is used for multitask models.
The save_path variable should be changed to one of these values:
'Models/trained_multitask_model.pth' for normal dataset
'Models/trained_multitask_distorted_model.pth' for distorted dataset

In both of these files, just change the variables to your liking and run the cell sequentially.
